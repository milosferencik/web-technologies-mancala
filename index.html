        * artificial intelligence level

    <!-- Identification
        * player must authenticate with login and password
        * after auth, allow the authenticated session to end
        * Assignment 1: created area for it, but authemtication will come in next assignments
    -->

    <!-- State
        * this area must show: 
            * number of stones in each of the "houses" (side pockets)
            * small holes
    -->

    <!-- Board
        * main area of the application
        * initially can be coded in HTML
        * positioning and graphic design must be done in CSS
        * afterwards, use JS using the DOM and the CSSOM, so that different boards can be generated depending on the settings 
        * identify data structure to represent the boarc
        * use OOP approach for the board
     -->
    
    <!-- Instructions
        * this area presents the game rules adn tips on how to play the game
    -->

    <!-- Leaderboard
        * leaderboard with the best scores registered
        * Assignment 1: scores only against the computer
        * later assignments will require scores to be taken from a server (player vs player)
        * also can be a "transitional panel" that opens with a command (ex: button click)
    -->

    <!-- Messages
        * Display messages during the game
        * Examples: "player must return to play", "player gave up and lost", "game ended with a victory of player X"
    -->

    <!-- Artificial Intelligence
        * Assignment 1: only against client (computer) locally
        * the simplest algorithm is to choose the move that produces the most number of player stones
        * the implementation of an algorithm that allows defining a level of difficulty will be valued
        * Minimax algorithm (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) can be implemented to play smarter. In this case the difficulty level can be mapped in depth.
